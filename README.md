# My Tweet Project

## Overview

This project is a simple tweeting website where users can post, edit, and delete short messages with media. It also allows users to view posts from other users. This README provides an overview of the setup, development, and functionality of the project, as well as instructions for running it locally.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: Django-based authentication system and basic tweeting API.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interacting with the backend and providing a user interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my_tweet_project.git
cd my_tweet_project

2. Create a Virtual Environment

bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Dependencies

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Backend Setup

    Install Django

    If Django is not already installed, you can install it using:

    bash

pip install django

Database Migrations

Run the following commands to set up the database:

bash

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Create a Superuser

To access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

bash

python manage.py createsuperuser

Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

bash

    python manage.py runserver

    The server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Testing

Ensure all functionalities are working by:

    Running the Development Server

    bash

    python manage.py runserver
